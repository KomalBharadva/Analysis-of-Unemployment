# Analysis-of-Unemployment
R Program and SPSS for analysis of “Unemployment using multiple regression technique”.

In this project we aim to evaluate Unemployment and statistically analyse whether unemployment is correlated or is dependent on other factors such as Population, Educational GDP and Research and Development GDP. We will then apply one of the statistical modelling techniques which is multiple regression since we have multiple dependent variables in the analysis. This correlation would further help us to predict the Unemployment rate.
